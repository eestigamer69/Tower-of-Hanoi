# Tower-of-Hanoi

Hello!

To run this game you need to have python downloaded

This is the first game I have made in python and I uploaded it here because I want it to be possible to see my programming portfolio somewhere

The game is based off the Tower of Hanoi game
The goal is to get all the discs from place A to place C by using letter A, B and C on your keyboard (must be capitalized)
The rulese are:
  you can only move 1 disc at a time
  you cant put a bigger disc on a smaller disc

And I think thats all
The game is pretty primitive though and might have errors, even though I don't think there should be any
